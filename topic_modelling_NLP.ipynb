       "['how pubg has redefined the indian gaming ecosystem forever indians are well and truly addicted to pubg thanks to affordable broadband access all over the country. the success of this online multiplayer game is clearly an inflection point for the indian gaming industry. will desi titles finally succeed?  earlier this month, i went to my home town in rajasthan and played pubg in the overnight bus from jaipur to bikaner. i thought i would play one game while the bus was still in jaipur as the game requires high speed data to play with 100 players synchronously. to my surprise, i ended up playing for four straight hours through the night while the bus travelled through rural rajasthan - and the game worked throughout! it was just one example of how india is now truly connected and how things that we thought were unimaginable not so long ago are a reality today. when jio rolled out its nationwide network and slashed wireless broadband prices, it unleashed – among other things – the tailwind needed for the development of the indian mobile gaming ecosystem. global games with a massive following in other markets have been waiting on the sidelines for a long time. pubg, from tencent, has not only taken the lead in gaining the indian gaming mindshare but is leading the way for the creation of amazing games for india over the next decade. when i was moving back to india two years ago, one thing was clear to me – india’s masses have a lot of free time. whenever i spent time at my cousin’s shop in a tier 3 town, or in my village in rajasthan, i could see that people had at least 3-4 hours to kill during their work day. this is excluding the 5-6 hours they have after work when there is little to do in these small towns. this insight made me a firm believer that if a company could provide a credible way for people to kill time on their phones, adoption would be massive. again, from global experience, i felt that video consumption and mobile gaming would get maximum traction. we have seen the early signs of growth for the mobile gaming ecosystem in india for the last two years. game downloads have increased 8-10x, with the active mobile gaming population growing to approximately 200 million. [source: et bureau and app annie]. this number is expected to grow to 450 million by 2021. even though the numbers seem large, these are still early days of gaming in india. india has become the fifth-largest country by game downloads but remains far behind on gaming revenue. the most widely adopted games in india have, at best, been sub-100mb, single-player or turn-based games. here’s the thing: games are much more exciting when you play them with others, compete with them and gain recognition among friends and other gamers. most of india has not experienced this sort of multi-player gaming as yet; people who have played age of empires (aoe) or counter strike or quake during their undergrad days are a small subset and would relate to this format. i remember getting addicted to aoe during my iit days and playing it over lan with seven other players in teams of up to four (there are three modes – solo, duo and squad). the experience of playing it with other friends just made the game so much more interesting that we would play 14-16 hours a day at times and also watch the recordings of the game to improve our game. i remember reading about how (flipkart co-founder) sachin bansal was a pro quake player and played competitively during his iit days. and that’s how it was – pockets of players. in parallel, most mobile game developers i have spoken to have been very wary of developing multi-player and graphics-heavy games for india. their scepticism was based on their experiences from the last decade when india was truly crunched for data and, until recently, for phone space. this was the state until pubg hit our screens. in the right place at the right time\\nthe pubg phenomenon best showcases how rapidly india is changing beyond our expectations. pubg has redefined two things in a big way. firstly, it’s a 2gb game! i don’t think i have ever downloaded a 2gb app on my phone for anything, let alone a game. most indian game developers did not dare to make even a 500mb app in india as it was clear that we didn’t have phones that could support such large apps. the pattern here was that people often had to delete apps to install new apps and space was in short supply. every developer was so concerned about the size of the app that they would sacrifice graphics and the depth of the game to keep the app small. today, indians are downloading (and keeping) a 2gb app and 500-800 mb worth of updates every month. this is truly an unprecedented tie for the indian app and gaming ecosystem.',\n",
       " 'dream11 closes $100 m funding led by tencent; inches towards unicorn status  sports fantasy gaming company dream11 has raised $100 million in a series d funding round led by chinese investor tencent. the latest fund-raise takes the valuation of dream11 to $700 million-$800 million. dream11 allows gamers to create their winning teams and bet on their performance. team scores climb the charts with each performance at a real match. each good move gets gamers cash rewards, and dream11 keeps 15-20 percent of the winnings. according to flurry analytics india is second in the world in terms of time spent on gaming. it is behind the us and ahead of china and europe in terms of time spent. according to frost & sullivan, the indian gaming market will grow to $1.1 billion in 2021. the global games market generated revenue of $104.8 billion in 2016, up 12.6 percent from 2015. global revenue is likely to increase to $151.7 billion in 2021. dream11 was founded by harsh jain and bhavit sheth in 2012 and has categories including cricket, football, kabaddi, and basketball. it claims to have 2 crore users. growth in fantasy gaming is expected to be driven from southeast asia, the middle east and india as these regions have an advantage of favourable demographics and rising growth in smartphone penetration. according to frost & sullivan, india will contribute only 1 percent of the gaming economy. dream11’s funding raise comes after a long dry spell for the indian gaming industry. indiagames was sold to disney for $100 million in 2011, and ever since, deal sizes in the industry have been limited to small series b deals. 99games, octro, and nazara are some of the top gaming companies in india. mumbai-based dream11 has raised undisclosed amounts in three rounds of funding so far. the company now aims to take its user base to 10 crore by 2020.',\n",
       " 'how enterprise gaming has grown from a ridiculed opportunity into a leading trend  having spent a large part of my career in the financial services space driving traditional business growth, using gaming to achieve business goals was not a cause i expected to champion. gaming was always a personal interest, but the business parallels only became apparent after we started experimenting with service engagements for enterprises. given that the planet spends 3 billion hours a week playing games, the challenge was really to figure out how learning could fit into that construct. we formed quodeck in 2010 to fuse gaming with learning for enterprises. having started with some elementary game engines and simulations, we quickly moved to make an omnipotent system built with changing business environments in mind. the platform, as it stands today, caters to enterprise requirements for mobile learning. as a leading player in this category, our advice to new entrants is to stay true to course, understand that the market is huge, and that innovation is the key. mobility is here to stay\\nmobile learning was just appearing on the horizon in india when we entered the market. in fact, it was still at a nascent stage globally as well. while enterprises saw the demographic shift coming, the speed at which the device shift happened took everyone by surprise. within a period of 3-4 years, millennials had junked tablets and wouldn’t access desktops or laptops for anything but sit-down work. they wanted everything on their mobile, on-demand and anytime, anywhere. a generation bred on twitter, facebook, and youtube, they want content and technology which is easy-to-use, visually appealing, and in bite-sized pieces. the learning evolution that needed to happen in enterprises was phenomenal, and existing products were just not prepared for this. mobility, as a trend, has forced a change in behaviour, technology, content creation, and consumption patterns across all strata of business. there is always an element of luck in a startup’s success, and we were no different. perhaps being at the right place at the right time with the right thought process is what it’s all about. our personal insight of gaming being a habit-creating behaviour and of long-term associative memories was the inspiration behind the approach we took. we translated countless hours, behaviours, and constructs learned in gaming to address real-world problems with excellent results. having played on consoles like the playstation and xbox, we assumed the world was ready to deal with highly complex games. however, working closely with business heads, hr teams, and the learning & development functions, we learnt that hyper-casual games create the best impact from a learning perspective. this is because they are somewhat repetitive in nature, with a greater level of participation and addiction to ‘scoring’.for new players gaming as a learning solution is so vast in its scope that it can’t be locked with a particular industry or even a clutch of industries. wherever there is widespread staff or skilling required, gaming solutions can take charge and lead the change. when new players come in, they must remember that competition comes in various guises and is very rarely with another player. you will end up competing for mindshare against the likes of video-on-demand platforms or search engines, where users can find information and content at their fingertips. knowing what creates pull is perhaps the only challenge you should worry about. look out for learning opportunities gamification as an industry has widespread applications, with learning being only one of them. space was created for us because existing products failed to keep pace with what was required. overnight, enterprises recognized that resistance against this changing paradigm was futile, and mindsets started changing. gaming and mobility were no longer bad words.it would be foolish of us to think that we cannot be on the other side of such a trend. keeping your offering relevant and cutting-edge requires you to have an innovation engine which stops for nothing. this requires tremendous willpower and a stubborn refusal to settle into a comfortable spot. kamalika bhattacharya is ceo and co-founder of quodeck technologies.',\n",

       " \"confidence: women's last hurdle to making it to the boardroom women working at their full potential could add up to $28 trillion to the global gdp by 2025. yet, women don’t even make up half of the global workforce. women possess most of the characteristics of a good leader. this is a fact. they are more democratic and participative, possess effective problem-solving capabilities, empathy, and ethics, and tend to be great team-players, motivators, and role models.n america, only 5 percent ceos are women and according to the world economic forum, only 5 percent of the richest billionaires are women, 6 percent of s&p 500 companies have women ceos and only 20 percent of fortune 500 board members are women. in india, as on october 31, 2017, only about 15 percent directorship positions in nse-listed companies were occupied by women. when you compare both these sets of information, something doesn’t add up, right? because if we have most of the qualities of a good leader, why are the number of women in the higher echelons of power so dismal? well, yes there is patriarchy, especially for a country like india where the number of women in the workforce stands at a dismal 24.39 percent anyway, according to world bank data from september 2018, but let’s take the example of america. to cite the world economic forum again, women make up 47 percent of the workforce but the numbers mentioned above, even for america, clearly tell a different story. so, what else is at play here? different studies, instances and findings point towards the inherent confidence gap between men and women and it is this lack of confidence, which is costing women leadership positions. some examples of how this lack of confidence manifests itself.in a review of personnel records at hewlett-packard, women working at the company applied for a promotion only when they believed they met 100 percent of the qualifications listed for the job. men, on the other hand, were happy to apply when they thought they could meet 60 percent. women have a penchant for assuming the blame when things go wrong while crediting circumstance - or other people - for their successes. men do the opposite. when women get low grades in a difficult class, they blame themselves while men acknowledge the difficulty level of the module and are less hard on themselves. this is a classic example of ‘internal attribution’ vs ‘external attribution’, something catastrophically debilitating to the self-esteem of women. women also undervalue themselves and their competence when asked to assess their performance. men evaluate themselves in a much better light. in reality, their performances don’t differ significantly. women also tend to downplay their successes whereas men are naturally predisposed towards a fair amount of chest-thumping. in fact, the more senior a woman is, the more she makes a conscious effort to downplay her eloquence - the reverse of how most men handle power. to quote a 2014 report by mckinsey & company, “female executives are much less certain they will reach the top: 69 percent of mid-level or senior women said they are confident they will succeed in reaching a top-management position, compared with 83 percent of their male peers.”\\nyou get the point.\",\n",

       " 'these 5 stem-based activity startups are on a mission to make future generations smarter meet the five startups that are using digital technology to engage students and help them learn, programme, and experiment in the field of stem. the demand for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) skills is increasing exponentially. across the world, parents and educators are realising the importance of nurturing children’s stem skills with educational programmes and diy activities.according to the latest market study - global educational toys market 2017-2021 - by market research firm technavio, the global educational toys market is expected to grow at a cagr of close to 10 percent until 2021. the report suggests k-12 and stem learning are the primary focus of the educational toy market.the idea of experiential learning, if spread properly, can change the face of the indian education system. recent initiatives like atal innovation mission and the concept of atal tinkering labs is encouraging startups and students by giving wings to their creative ideas.and why not? the global market for stem educational toys is valued at $29 billion. of this, india accounts for about $235 million and is expected to grow to $500 million by 2020. stem is also one of the few categories of the toy industry that has shown consistent growth over the past five years; this growth is expected to be faster over the coming years.ensing the growing potential, several indian companies are trying to create a niche with innovative offerings in the educational toys market. we list five make-in-india companies that are aiming to make learning fun for children with their stem-based toys and activity sets.smartivity labs: delhi-based smartivity labs was launched in 2015 by tushar a amin and iit-delhi alumni apoorv gupta, rajat jain, and ashwini kumar. the startup is dedicated to the design, development, and sale of stem toys for children aged between 3 and 14 years. its portfolio includes physical stem educational do-it-yourself kits, and toys and activities that integrate cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality (ar), offering ar-enabled colouring sets and jigsaw puzzles.stemrobo: founded in 2015 by anurag gupta and rajiv tiwari, delhi-based stemrobo focuses on designing and making innovative electronic devices, software, and methodologies around stem robotics for india’s k-12 segment. incubated in delhi’s electropreneur park, stemrobo offers innovative models and project-based learning around stem-robotics. stemrobo’s solutions are a combination of hardware kits (10 kinds of diy models for different age groups), software, content, and services (online and campus training for kits via stemrobo certified trainers).avishkaar box: started in 2008 by tarun and swati gupta, delhi-based avishkaar box aims to make children understand tech and science concepts in an effective and engaging way. avishkaar box is a bundle of monthly theme-based educational kit for children that can be purchased as standalone kit or a year-long subscription. the startup has developed two boxes - steam and inventors. steam is a science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics-based educational kit for students of class 1 and 2. inventors boxes focus on specific technology themes like robotics, and are for children from class 2 to 10. in july 2016 three engineering graduates, abhishek sharma, dhrupal shah, and pankaj kumar verma, all alumni of iit-kanpur, developed evive to simplify learning, skill development, and project making in the field of stem. their device is designed to help students and tech enthusiasts learn, build, and debug robotics; embed systems; and other projects. the open-source embedded platform is powered by arduino mega (a programmable microcontroller board referred to as the “brain” in electronics and related projects) and offers an on-screen menu, eliminating the pain of re-programming the arduino repeatedly. the device is coupled with an online learning centre, aimed at providing an enriched do-it-yourself experience for tech enthusiasts of all age groups. robotix learning solutions: founded in 2009 by as ramana prasad, robotix offers robotics education for kids through an interdisciplinary approach, where stem teaching happens in an interesting and innovative manner. besides nurturing stem skills and helping students take classroom skills to a higher level with its robotics and coding education programmes, the firm has also developed three robots - phiro, taco playbits, and taco robobricks - to help children learn coding and enhance their stem skills with ease.',\n",
       " 'startup valuation: art, science or both? a good approach to valuing a startup involves an adroit mix of scientific and gut-feel approaches. startups get valued at various stages of their evolution. this exercise is necessary at many times and recommended at others. during “inflection points” like a funding round it is absolutely necessary - for the obvious reason that new shares have to be issued and stakes carved out for incoming investors. it is recommended at other times for vcs to value their portfolio (as the sum of all startup valuations).\\n\\nthe key point here is that startups need to undergo this valuation exercise at regular intervals. and the exercise has to be done with as little or as much data being available (with little data being the norm).\\nthere are many approaches to valuing a startup - with “dcf” and “comparables” being the ones typically used most often by early stage vcs. dcf is an abbreviated form of discounted cash flow - a classical valuation technique taught ubiquitously at business schools.\\n\\nfinancial rigour aside, it essentially involves estimating cash flows five years into the future, and then deducing the \\'perpetual\\' cash flow by taking the fifth year cash flow and ascribing a steady state growth rate. these cash flows are then discounted back to the present by a discount rate often referred to as wacc (rhymes with hack) - an abbreviated form of weighted average cost of capital.\\n\\ndcf is both scientific, yet hard to use in the startup scenario due to the sheer number of variables that can alter the cash flows of the future. even the cost of capital is hard to calculate because it involves an estimation of a startups\\' risk - something we know can also change within very short intervals. even then, dcf is used regularly as one of the best (educated) guesses of valuation - at a minimum as a \\'sanity check\\' to ensure that purported valuations are within range of estimates.\\n\\nthe other commonly used technique is called \\'comparables\\' - with the premise that a startups\\' valuation is being estimated by finding a company with very similar metrics - team size, technology, addressable market, growth rates, etc. and using that company\\'s valuation at the latest transaction - an m&a or funding event as the best estimate of valuation and using that for its own purpose. while easy to calculate, comparables tend to oversimplify many dynamics unique to a startup and end up \\'bucketising\\' companies into valuation ranges.\\n\\nfurther, a technique to value a startup, especially when considering an m&a transaction popular amongst corporate development groups i am told, is to value a startup as if it were a division of a larger company.\\nthat is, conduct valuation exercises like dcf for the revenues and expenses for the product and team and assume that the entire groups are supported by common business functions like hr and corporate marketing.\\n\\ni\\'d be remiss to neglect one lesser used, but sound, methodology called replacement value. replacement value essentially calculates the entire cost of recreating the startup from scratch, or rather from a business plan sketched on a napkin. by calculating the cost to hire a team, build a product, generate a brand, and sell into the marketplace and so on. typically a premium is added to the replacement value (again usually in m&a events) as the value for controlling the company.\\n\\nso, where does the art come in?\\nwith an abundance of valuation techniques (and we have not covered all of these), the question arises - where does the art in valuation come in. and the answer lies between the lines in the above descriptions - the notion of estimates at every step in these scientific methodologies. estimation soon becomes an art - with more experienced vcs typically better at it. subjectivity often comes into play and gut feel some becomes an arbiter between a \\'white hot startup with a stellar team that can easily grow at 200 percent plus every year\\' and \\'a startup with interesting technology but questionable execution skills and one that will fail numerous hurdles in growing even modestly\\' . the former will attract a pre-money valuation of $5m a series a round and the latter will attract pre-series a money (to start with) at a valuation of $1m.much of the confidence, or lack thereof, in evaluating a company\\'s prowess comes from in-person meetings between investors and founders; with some investors walking away \\'feeling it\\', that is sensing a great degree of confidence in the situation and willing to go the distance with the founding team.in such scenarios, vcs might use one of the above techniques to as a starting point for valuation negotiation, but soon enough let emotion and/or competitive situations to get the better of them - ending up with figures significantly different from the starting point. good vcs are sizing up situations and arriving at \"likelihood-weighted estimates\" and by extension, realistic valuation estimates.in conclusion, i would say that a good approach to valuing a startup involves an adroit mix of scientific and gut-feel approaches - but an endeavor worth taking up in earnest. an endeavour that uses scientific analysis, human judgement and classical x-factors. an endeavour that is challenging but achievable, one that can precipitate substantial monetary benefits.',\n",

       "['how pubg has redefined the indian gaming ecosystem forever indians are well and truly addicted to pubg thanks to affordable broadband access all over the country. the success of this online multiplayer game is clearly an inflection point for the indian gaming industry. will desi titles finally succeed?  earlier this month, i went to my home town in rajasthan and played pubg in the overnight bus from jaipur to bikaner. i thought i would play one game while the bus was still in jaipur as the game requires high speed data to play with 100 players synchronously. to my surprise, i ended up playing for four straight hours through the night while the bus travelled through rural rajasthan - and the game worked throughout! it was just one example of how india is now truly connected and how things that we thought were unimaginable not so long ago are a reality today. when jio rolled out its nationwide network and slashed wireless broadband prices, it unleashed  among other things  the tailwind needed for the development of the indian mobile gaming ecosystem. global games with a massive following in other markets have been waiting on the sidelines for a long time. pubg, from tencent, has not only taken the lead in gaining the indian gaming mindshare but is leading the way for the creation of amazing games for india over the next decade. when i was moving back to india two years ago, one thing was clear to me  indias masses have a lot of free time. whenever i spent time at my cousins shop in a tier 3 town, or in my village in rajasthan, i could see that people had at least 3-4 hours to kill during their work day. this is excluding the 5-6 hours they have after work when there is little to do in these small towns. this insight made me a firm believer that if a company could provide a credible way for people to kill time on their phones, adoption would be massive. again, from global experience, i felt that video consumption and mobile gaming would get maximum traction. we have seen the early signs of growth for the mobile gaming ecosystem in india for the last two years. game downloads have increased 8-10x, with the active mobile gaming population growing to approximately 200 million. [source: et bureau and app annie]. this number is expected to grow to 450 million by 2021. even though the numbers seem large, these are still early days of gaming in india. india has become the fifth-largest country by game downloads but remains far behind on gaming revenue. the most widely adopted games in india have, at best, been sub-100mb, single-player or turn-based games. heres the thing: games are much more exciting when you play them with others, compete with them and gain recognition among friends and other gamers. most of india has not experienced this sort of multi-player gaming as yet; people who have played age of empires (aoe) or counter strike or quake during their undergrad days are a small subset and would relate to this format. i remember getting addicted to aoe during my iit days and playing it over lan with seven other players in teams of up to four (there are three modes  solo, duo and squad). the experience of playing it with other friends just made the game so much more interesting that we would play 14-16 hours a day at times and also watch the recordings of the game to improve our game. i remember reading about how (flipkart co-founder) sachin bansal was a pro quake player and played competitively during his iit days. and thats how it was  pockets of players. in parallel, most mobile game developers i have spoken to have been very wary of developing multi-player and graphics-heavy games for india. their scepticism was based on their experiences from the last decade when india was truly crunched for data and, until recently, for phone space. this was the state until pubg hit our screens. in the right place at the right time\\nthe pubg phenomenon best showcases how rapidly india is changing beyond our expectations. pubg has redefined two things in a big way. firstly, its a 2gb game! i dont think i have ever downloaded a 2gb app on my phone for anything, let alone a game. most indian game developers did not dare to make even a 500mb app in india as it was clear that we didnt have phones that could support such large apps. the pattern here was that people often had to delete apps to install new apps and space was in short supply. every developer was so concerned about the size of the app that they would sacrifice graphics and the depth of the game to keep the app small. today, indians are downloading (and keeping) a 2gb app and 500-800 mb worth of updates every month. this is truly an unprecedented tie for the indian app and gaming ecosystem.',\n",

       " 'how enterprise gaming has grown from a ridiculed opportunity into a leading trend  having spent a large part of my career in the financial services space driving traditional business growth, using gaming to achieve business goals was not a cause i expected to champion. gaming was always a personal interest, but the business parallels only became apparent after we started experimenting with service engagements for enterprises. given that the planet spends 3 billion hours a week playing games, the challenge was really to figure out how learning could fit into that construct. we formed quodeck in 2010 to fuse gaming with learning for enterprises. having started with some elementary game engines and simulations, we quickly moved to make an omnipotent system built with changing business environments in mind. the platform, as it stands today, caters to enterprise requirements for mobile learning. as a leading player in this category, our advice to new entrants is to stay true to course, understand that the market is huge, and that innovation is the key. mobility is here to stay\\nmobile learning was just appearing on the horizon in india when we entered the market. in fact, it was still at a nascent stage globally as well. while enterprises saw the demographic shift coming, the speed at which the device shift happened took everyone by surprise. within a period of 3-4 years, millennials had junked tablets and wouldnt access desktops or laptops for anything but sit-down work. they wanted everything on their mobile, on-demand and anytime, anywhere. a generation bred on twitter, facebook, and youtube, they want content and technology which is easy-to-use, visually appealing, and in bite-sized pieces. the learning evolution that needed to happen in enterprises was phenomenal, and existing products were just not prepared for this. mobility, as a trend, has forced a change in behaviour, technology, content creation, and consumption patterns across all strata of business. there is always an element of luck in a startups success, and we were no different. perhaps being at the right place at the right time with the right thought process is what its all about. our personal insight of gaming being a habit-creating behaviour and of long-term associative memories was the inspiration behind the approach we took. we translated countless hours, behaviours, and constructs learned in gaming to address real-world problems with excellent results. having played on consoles like the playstation and xbox, we assumed the world was ready to deal with highly complex games. however, working closely with business heads, hr teams, and the learning & development functions, we learnt that hyper-casual games create the best impact from a learning perspective. this is because they are somewhat repetitive in nature, with a greater level of participation and addiction to scoring.for new players gaming as a learning solution is so vast in its scope that it cant be locked with a particular industry or even a clutch of industries. wherever there is widespread staff or skilling required, gaming solutions can take charge and lead the change. when new players come in, they must remember that competition comes in various guises and is very rarely with another player. you will end up competing for mindshare against the likes of video-on-demand platforms or search engines, where users can find information and content at their fingertips. knowing what creates pull is perhaps the only challenge you should worry about. look out for learning opportunities gamification as an industry has widespread applications, with learning being only one of them. space was created for us because existing products failed to keep pace with what was required. overnight, enterprises recognized that resistance against this changing paradigm was futile, and mindsets started changing. gaming and mobility were no longer bad words.it would be foolish of us to think that we cannot be on the other side of such a trend. keeping your offering relevant and cutting-edge requires you to have an innovation engine which stops for nothing. this requires tremendous willpower and a stubborn refusal to settle into a comfortable spot. kamalika bhattacharya is ceo and co-founder of quodeck technologies.',\n",

       " \"confidence: women's last hurdle to making it to the boardroom women working at their full potential could add up to $28 trillion to the global gdp by 2025. yet, women dont even make up half of the global workforce. women possess most of the characteristics of a good leader. this is a fact. they are more democratic and participative, possess effective problem-solving capabilities, empathy, and ethics, and tend to be great team-players, motivators, and role models.n america, only 5 percent ceos are women and according to the world economic forum, only 5 percent of the richest billionaires are women, 6 percent of s&p 500 companies have women ceos and only 20 percent of fortune 500 board members are women. in india, as on october 31, 2017, only about 15 percent directorship positions in nse-listed companies were occupied by women. when you compare both these sets of information, something doesnt add up, right? because if we have most of the qualities of a good leader, why are the number of women in the higher echelons of power so dismal? well, yes there is patriarchy, especially for a country like india where the number of women in the workforce stands at a dismal 24.39 percent anyway, according to world bank data from september 2018, but lets take the example of america. to cite the world economic forum again, women make up 47 percent of the workforce but the numbers mentioned above, even for america, clearly tell a different story. so, what else is at play here? different studies, instances and findings point towards the inherent confidence gap between men and women and it is this lack of confidence, which is costing women leadership positions. some examples of how this lack of confidence manifests itself.in a review of personnel records at hewlett-packard, women working at the company applied for a promotion only when they believed they met 100 percent of the qualifications listed for the job. men, on the other hand, were happy to apply when they thought they could meet 60 percent. women have a penchant for assuming the blame when things go wrong while crediting circumstance - or other people - for their successes. men do the opposite. when women get low grades in a difficult class, they blame themselves while men acknowledge the difficulty level of the module and are less hard on themselves. this is a classic example of internal attribution vs external attribution, something catastrophically debilitating to the self-esteem of women. women also undervalue themselves and their competence when asked to assess their performance. men evaluate themselves in a much better light. in reality, their performances dont differ significantly. women also tend to downplay their successes whereas men are naturally predisposed towards a fair amount of chest-thumping. in fact, the more senior a woman is, the more she makes a conscious effort to downplay her eloquence - the reverse of how most men handle power. to quote a 2014 report by mckinsey & company, female executives are much less certain they will reach the top: 69 percent of mid-level or senior women said they are confident they will succeed in reaching a top-management position, compared with 83 percent of their male peers.\\nyou get the point.\",\n",

       " 'startup valuation: art, science or both? a good approach to valuing a startup involves an adroit mix of scientific and gut-feel approaches. startups get valued at various stages of their evolution. this exercise is necessary at many times and recommended at others. during inflection points like a funding round it is absolutely necessary - for the obvious reason that new shares have to be issued and stakes carved out for incoming investors. it is recommended at other times for vcs to value their portfolio (as the sum of all startup valuations).\\n\\nthe key point here is that startups need to undergo this valuation exercise at regular intervals. and the exercise has to be done with as little or as much data being available (with little data being the norm).\\nthere are many approaches to valuing a startup - with dcf and comparables being the ones typically used most often by early stage vcs. dcf is an abbreviated form of discounted cash flow - a classical valuation technique taught ubiquitously at business schools.\\n\\nfinancial rigour aside, it essentially involves estimating cash flows five years into the future, and then deducing the \\'perpetual\\' cash flow by taking the fifth year cash flow and ascribing a steady state growth rate. these cash flows are then discounted back to the present by a discount rate often referred to as wacc (rhymes with hack) - an abbreviated form of weighted average cost of capital.\\n\\ndcf is both scientific, yet hard to use in the startup scenario due to the sheer number of variables that can alter the cash flows of the future. even the cost of capital is hard to calculate because it involves an estimation of a startups\\' risk - something we know can also change within very short intervals. even then, dcf is used regularly as one of the best (educated) guesses of valuation - at a minimum as a \\'sanity check\\' to ensure that purported valuations are within range of estimates.\\n\\nthe other commonly used technique is called \\'comparables\\' - with the premise that a startups\\' valuation is being estimated by finding a company with very similar metrics - team size, technology, addressable market, growth rates, etc. and using that company\\'s valuation at the latest transaction - an m&a or funding event as the best estimate of valuation and using that for its own purpose. while easy to calculate, comparables tend to oversimplify many dynamics unique to a startup and end up \\'bucketising\\' companies into valuation ranges.\\n\\nfurther, a technique to value a startup, especially when considering an m&a transaction popular amongst corporate development groups i am told, is to value a startup as if it were a division of a larger company.\\nthat is, conduct valuation exercises like dcf for the revenues and expenses for the product and team and assume that the entire groups are supported by common business functions like hr and corporate marketing.\\n\\ni\\'d be remiss to neglect one lesser used, but sound, methodology called replacement value. replacement value essentially calculates the entire cost of recreating the startup from scratch, or rather from a business plan sketched on a napkin. by calculating the cost to hire a team, build a product, generate a brand, and sell into the marketplace and so on. typically a premium is added to the replacement value (again usually in m&a events) as the value for controlling the company.\\n\\nso, where does the art come in?\\nwith an abundance of valuation techniques (and we have not covered all of these), the question arises - where does the art in valuation come in. and the answer lies between the lines in the above descriptions - the notion of estimates at every step in these scientific methodologies. estimation soon becomes an art - with more experienced vcs typically better at it. subjectivity often comes into play and gut feel some becomes an arbiter between a \\'white hot startup with a stellar team that can easily grow at 200 percent plus every year\\' and \\'a startup with interesting technology but questionable execution skills and one that will fail numerous hurdles in growing even modestly\\' . the former will attract a pre-money valuation of $5m a series a round and the latter will attract pre-series a money (to start with) at a valuation of $1m.much of the confidence, or lack thereof, in evaluating a company\\'s prowess comes from in-person meetings between investors and founders; with some investors walking away \\'feeling it\\', that is sensing a great degree of confidence in the situation and willing to go the distance with the founding team.in such scenarios, vcs might use one of the above techniques to as a starting point for valuation negotiation, but soon enough let emotion and/or competitive situations to get the better of them - ending up with figures significantly different from the starting point. good vcs are sizing up situations and arriving at \"likelihood-weighted estimates\" and by extension, realistic valuation estimates.in conclusion, i would say that a good approach to valuing a startup involves an adroit mix of scientific and gut-feel approaches - but an endeavor worth taking up in earnest. an endeavour that uses scientific analysis, human judgement and classical x-factors. an endeavour that is challenging but achievable, one that can precipitate substantial monetary benefits.',\n",

       " 'how to get funding at an idea level  this is an interesting one and works in reality. people have made tons of money from investing in real estate and traditional businesses. now, they are attracted towards internet companies after listening to stories about the whatsapp acquisition, where investors are still counting the zeros in $19 billion, the valuation given by facebook. if you go to such an investor, and tell him that you can make an app like whatsapp and sell it, chances are he will take the bait.\\n\\nbut beware, if you make fool out of people, you will have to pay them back in some form in the future. indians believe in karma, so think twice before taking any such action. get investors who understand your market.\\nthere is no other way to raise money at the ideation level. if i am missing something then please let me know in the comments. but, that does not mean you can not raise funds. you can, but not at idea level. you have to execute the idea. make a product and get your initial customers. always ask yourself these questions when you think about raising money. are you starting your company to solve the customers problems or raise money? the answer should be both.whos your priority  the customer or your investor? have you talked to fifty customers? have you offered a solution, or even a minimum viable product (mvp)? how will you get customers to your platform? what have you tried and proved to acquire customers? focus on promotional strategies like social media, seo, etc. otherwise they will sound good only on paper. how will you make your business profitable? dont assume that you will figure out something on the fly. plan for either 1000x growth or monetisation. a free platform works only when you have thousands of customers installing your app on a daily basis. at the end of the day, any business runs on profits. assume for a while that you are an investor. why would you invest in a strangers company? an investor gets hundreds of business proposals on a daily basis. how can you shine in a pile of startup business plans? i would suggest you at least get to work. build something that customers love. make a significant positive difference in human lives. prove that your product is the right fit for the current market.if the market is big enough, and you have a brilliant product (not just an idea) to serve customers, then funding will follow you. a true entrepreneur is resourceful. he can figure out how to make things happen even with scarce resources.',\n",

       " 'gurugram-based propstory bridges communication gaps between realty buyers, sellers bootstrapped propstory provides information and reviews about properties; plans to be a credible online content platform connecting all stakeholders in the real estate industry. two iit-bombay graduates who joined the prestigious institute in 1999 met after a decade, and with their combined experience in the real estate and technology sector, decided to do something in the housing segment.\\n\\nthe real estate sector in india is riddled with challenges, and there are numerous reports of project delays, and a lack of transparency.\\n\\nwith an idea to solve these problems, and to bridge the information gap between the property developers and buyers, propstory was founded in july 2015 by ashish mahajan and bhagwandas paliwal. it is a digital content marketing platform that focuses on the real estate sector, especially homes. the startup also aims to ensure transparency in all forms of communication.\\n\\nbridging the communication gap\\nashish says, i could see the sector was going to get into trouble as many developers did not have a strong customer connect. they did not meet the basic needs of the customers.\\n\\nwe got traction from leading developers like godrej and the tatas, who were interested in our form of communication, and effectively market them so that the customers come onto their websites, says ashish.\\n\\nhe says that in the current scenario, there is no effective marketing of housing projects as classifieds are driven by brokers who look for short-term gains, while developers marketing spend was largely a clichd job of advertisements. a classical print advertisement of a real estate developer has the impact on the readers only for two-to-three days. later, there is a need for a regular update on the projects. this is where propstory comes into play.we want customers to interact on our platform, which in turn becomes a great communication medium. the biggest problem has been the information gap during the initial phase and execution of the real estate projects, ashish says. propstory has been telling the developers to make self-disclosures, which has become a big tool in ensuring transparency.propstorys content is written like a blog, which includes actual visits to the project sites. part of their content is sponsored, while a majority of it is generic.ashish says, when a customer lands on our page, the content is authentic, and what we communicate to them is not far from reality.market reachpropstory primarily focuses on major metros such as mumbai, gurugram, noida, bengaluru, chennai, hyderabad, and pune. most of the users visiting its website are focused on projects in the range of rs 50 lakh to rs 1 crore.its competitors include real estate online portals such as 99acres and magicbricks.com, though the differentiation is that propstory is purely a content marketing platform, and does not engage in any kind of transactions.the future prospects look bright for the startup. ashish says the marketing budget of real estate developers is only going to increase in the days to come, and they will only look at enhancing the effectiveness of their campaigns. in our engagement with developers, we are able to give them inquiries at a lower cost, and it is also more about quality buyers, ashish says.propstory is currently focused only on the primary real estate market, which includes the sale of apartments, and does not have operations in the rental segment or secondary market.according to ashish, today, it is all about how well one can package the content. our team is focused on getting the right kind of content, which consumers would like to read. a lot of non-sponsored content is being referred actively by the users, ashish says.',\n",
